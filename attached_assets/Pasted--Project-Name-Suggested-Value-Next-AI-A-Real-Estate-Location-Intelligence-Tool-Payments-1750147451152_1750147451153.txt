📌 Project Name (Suggested): Value Next AI– A Real Estate Location Intelligence Tool



Payments: Razorpay integration (I will provide keys)

APIs: Google Maps Platform (only triggered based on plan)

🧠 Core Idea:
Build a single-page web app that lets users input or pin a location and amount they're paying for land/plot/property. The tool evaluates if it’s a good investment using Google Maps APIs. Offers three plans: Free, Paid (₹99), Pro (₹199).

🖥️ Pages (1 Main Page + 1 Result Page for Paid/Pro)
1️⃣ MAIN PAGE (Airbnb-like design):
Hero section with brand name, tagline ("Smartest Way to Judge Land Value")

2 input options:

Pin on Map (Google Maps JS API)

Enter Location Manually (Geocoding API)

Field: “Enter the amount you are paying”

Select dropdown: Type of property → Plot, Farm Land, House, Apartment, etc.

CTA buttons:

“Get Free Report”

“Unlock Full Report – ₹99”

“Get Investment Suggestions – ₹199”

Minimalistic pricing box showing 3 plans (Free, Paid, Pro)

Below: 3 cards showing sample analysis (non-clickable for teaser effect)

2️⃣ RESULT PAGE (only if Paid or Pro is clicked and payment is done):
Download PDF / Shareable Card (optional)

Report generated using API results

GPT-powered summary using ChatGPT API (optional, if added)

Razorpay payment is completed

Proper plan is selected

Limit API calls by:

Free: Max 3 uses/day per IP

Paid/Pro: Unlimited

All API usage must be scoped based on selected plan before loading scripts

💰 Payment Flow
Use Razorpay Checkout for ₹99 (Paid) and ₹199 (Pro)

On payment success:

Store session key (local/sessionStorage)

Unlock corresponding APIs and redirect to Report page

Show fallback if payment fails

🎯 Bonus Suggestions (if time permits):
Google Charts to show trend graphs in Paid

Generate downloadable report card using JS/PDF

Future: Add crime/traffic/air-quality APIs (not now)
