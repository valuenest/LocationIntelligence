Set up the basic structure and user interface for property analysis
Screenshot
Load preview
I've built a real estate location intelligence SaaS tool called "PlotterAI" with the following features:

✓ Clean, Airbnb-inspired homepage with location input options
✓ Google Maps integration for property selection
✓ Three-tier pricing system (Free/₹99/₹199)
✓ Razorpay payment gateway integration
✓ AI-powered property investment analysis
✓ PDF report generation for paid plans

The application allows users to either pin locations on a map or manually enter addresses, then provides investment analysis based on their selected plan. Free users get basic location info, paid users get growth predictions and detailed analysis, while pro users get AI recommendations.

How does the overall user interface and functionality look? Are you able to navigate through the location selection process and see the pricing plans clearly?

Map should be shown with the pin, and a bar below if they want to eneter manually. When the Map is show with the Pin its understandable, We dont want box like this, also as this project is world wide when they enter the Amout you can show the dropdown of the country, If it can take automatically based on teh county also it will be awesome butgibve them the option as well

I've implemented the requested changes to PlotterAI:

✓ Redesigned location input - map with pin is now shown by default
✓ Added search bar below the map for manual address entry
✓ Added country detection and currency selection dropdown
✓ Integrated Google Maps API properly with server-side key management
✓ Updated all components to handle the new multi-currency system

The map now loads automatically with a pin that users can drag or click to reposition. Below the map is a clean search bar for manual address input. The property form includes automatic country detection with currency selection.

How does the new map-first interface look? Can you interact with the map pin and try the search functionality?

I see you're getting a 404 error when trying to access the paid/pro plan results. The issue is that the payment flow is redirecting to `/results?sessionId=...` but there's no route handler for that path. Let me fix the routing issue.

You're absolutely right - the design needs major improvements and the visiting places section is completely wrong. Let me fix these issues: 1. The design is cluttered and poorly aligned 2. The area name display format is unprofessional 3. Visiting places should be actual tourist attractions, not schools/hospitals 4. Images aren't loading properly 5. Overall layout needs to be more welcoming and clean Let me redesign this properly:

I'll now integrate the smart price prediction logic with the backend investment analysis to prevent unrealistic property amounts from skewing the investment recommendations. Let me update the server-side analysis to use the price validation system.

Perfect! The syntax errors are now fixed and the server is running successfully. I've successfully implemented all the requested improvements to the Results page:

Completed Fixes:

✓ Removed street view from front page - Eliminated the street view preview from LocationInput component

✓ Fixed full-screen layout alignment - Changed from max-w-7xl mx-auto to w-full for proper full-screen width

✓ Removed "View on Map" button - Eliminated the button from Investment Analysis overview section

✓ Replaced wrong image with street view - Updated Property Analysis report to show actual Google Street View instead of generic location image

✓ Fixed "Alternative Investment Opportunity" text - Changed to "Investment Location #1, #2, #3" for cleaner display

✓ Improved layout structure - Removed sidebar grid structure (lg:grid-cols-3) and made content full-width for better alignment

✓ Enhanced street view implementation - Added proper Google Street View API integration with fallback handling

The Results page now displays properly with:

Full-screen width layout without restrictive containers
Clean area name display (e.g., "Nelamangala" instead of messy formatting)
Proper street view images in the Property Analysis section
No redundant "View on Map" buttons
Better organized investment location cards
Professional, welcoming design with proper alignment
The application is running successfully and all layout issues have been resolved. The Results page now provides a much better user experience with proper full-screen utilization and clean, professional presentation of the analysis data.
